For running:
    - We should be in the 'src' folder to run the. Do not run 'main.py' from any other folder.



OBSERVATIONS:
1. A very interesting observation I had during training the model on MNIST was that when I trained the model using the
raw values provided in the dataset (gray-scale images where each pixel has a value from 0-255), the model had difficulty
to produce any meaningful digit, all it was producing was simply meaningless noise.
However, when I normalized the 8-bit value of each pixel to the 0-1 interval (by dividing by 255) it was able to produce
digits very well. Interestingly, it seems that the huge variation between the pixel values in the case of the raw values
disabled the model to learn the patterns, while the normalized values help the model better understand and generate the
patterns.

2. num_workers=4 is problematic on T4 as well
